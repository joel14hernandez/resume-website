                        <p>I am a graduate from the University of Vermont looking for a job. As a young child, I found computers to be interesting and “magical” in how they could do all these things appear on screens with ones and zeros. While studying in NYC I transferred to University of Vermont to follow my interest in computer science. </p>
                        <p>There I learned a great deal about the many different areas dealing with computer science. A few areas that I've gained experience in include data structure, web design, computer architecture, programming, and software engineering. In my free time, I enjoy programming random things and taking part in competitive video game tournaments.</p>
